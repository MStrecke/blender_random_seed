blender_random_seed
===================

This addon chooses a different random seed for Cycles before rendering.

This is useful if you use image stacking to remove noise from your renders (and forget to change the seed value manually).

This addon appends the checkbox `Random Seed` to the `Render - Sampling` panel to (de)activate this feature.
